    "## Overview\n",
    "Machine learning offers a number of methods for classifying data into discrete categories, such as k-means clustering. Decision trees provide a structure for such categorization, based on a series of decisions that led to separate distinct outcomes. In this assignment, you will work with decision trees to perform binary classification according to some decision boundary. Your challenge is to build and to train decision trees capable of solving useful classification problems. You will learn first how to build decision trees, then how to effectively train them and finally how to test their performance.\n",

Whether one is training a deep neural network on millions of images, building random forests over a large dataset, or utilizing other algorithms, machine learning makes _extensive_ use of vectorization. In python, the **numpy** package provides a programmer with the ability to use python-wrapped, low-level optimizations written in C, however, the technique may feel strange at first and requires some practice to use comfortably.\n",

    "## The Assignment\n",
    "Classification is used widely in machine learning to figure out how to sort new data that comes through.  You will build, train and test decision tree models to perform basic classification tasks. Students should understand how decision trees and random forests work. This will help you develop an intuition for how and why accuracy differs for training and testing data based on different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "For this assignment we're going to need an explicit way to make structured decisions. The `DecisionNode` class will be used to represent a decision node as some atomic choice in a binary decision graph. We would only use this implementation of the Decision Tree for this assignment and any other implementations will be checked against and denied credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object from the 'DecisionNode' can represent a class label (i.e. a final decision) or a binary decision to guide us through a flow-chart to arrive at a decision. Note that in this representation 'True' values for a decision take us to the left. This choice is arbitrary, but this is used in the hint below.\n",
